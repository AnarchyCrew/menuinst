#
# cmd: (required)

#         is specified in custom_tools\Property.dat by ADDTOLAUNCHER, if the

#         is True.
#
# desktop: (optional, boolean)

# MENUS is an *optional* variable which specifies the menus to install the
# application into.  The example below is what MENUS defaults to in a
# an EPD installed Python.  This default is obtained from the of values NAME
# and FULL_VERSION exposed in custom_tools.
#
# parent: (optional, defaults to None)
#     Where to place the menu shortcuts defined above, that is specifying
#     the parent of the menu to install.  Possible values are:
#
#        'ROOT'  :     root of the menu tree structure
#
#         None   :     The leaf nodes of the menu (sub-menus).
#
#         id     :     an id string specifying the node.  In the example
#                      (since the parent is the leaf node) we could also
#                      have specified:
#                         'parent': ['enthought.epd_py25-4.1.301']
#                      which is more to type, but since the default is None,
#                      we could have omitted the 'parent' key altogether.
