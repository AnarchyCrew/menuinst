"""
Example appinst data file, note that this is Python code


Purpose of this file:
=====================

To be able to install an application using all the functionality
that AppInst provides in a single file.  For example you can install
of an application using the code:

   import appinst
   appinst.install_from_dat("ipython.dat")

However you are not required to use this file, you can also call the
various functions AppInst provides yourself.  Just likely having to
write more code yourself.


Variables to define:
====================

At least the variable SHORTCUTS must be defined to declare something
for AppInst to do.


AppInst will install all shortcuts in a menu named by:
custom_tools.FULL_NAME
"""

# SHORTCUTS defines the shortcuts to the application(s) in a cross-platform
# way.  That is:
#   * On Windows: The menus end up in the 'Start Menu', quicklaunch icons
#       end up in the QuickLaunch bar, and desktop icons show up on user's
#       desktops.
#   * On OSX: The menus end up in the '/Applications' directory, quicklaunch
#       icons are added to the Dock, and desktop icons show up on the user's
#       desktop.
#   * On Linux: The menus end up in the Gnome or KDE system menus, quicklaunch
#       icons are currently ignored, and desktop icons get added to the user's
#       desktop.
#
# SHORTCUTS is a list of dictionaries, one dictionary per desired shortcut.
# Each shortcut dictionary can have the following keys:
#
# cmd: (required)
#   The command line arguments to start the application the shortcut refers
#   to.
#
# comment: (optional)
#   The flyover help for the created shortcut.  On Windows, this is what you
#   see in a yellow box when hovering over a menu item.
#
# icon: (optional)
#   A Windows-formatted .ico file.  Used on both Windows and Linux.
#
# icns: (optional)
#   An OSX .icns file, default to 'PythonInterpreter.icns' (Python rocket)
#
# id: (required)
#   A id for this shortcut.  This is used to name the shortcut files on
#   platforms where the filename is not the display name the user sees.
#
# name: (required)
#   The display name of the shortcut as shown to the user.
#
# terminal: (required, boolean)
#   Whether or not the application starts a terminal (like ipython does)
#
# quicklaunch: (optional, boolean)
#   Whether or not a quicklaunch item should be created for this shortcut.
#   This does not solely determine if a quicklaunch item will be created as
#   the user must have granted permission to create quicklaunch shortcuts at
#   all during the installation of the application environment this shortcut
#   request is part of. That setting is the ADDTOLAUNCHER variable stored in
#   custom_tools\Property.dat.  When the Property.dat file does not exist,
#   the default for ADDTOLAUNCHER is True, which means this setting controls
#   whether the quicklaunch shortcut is created or not.
#
# desktop: (optional, boolean)
#   Whether or not a desktop item should be created for this shortcut.
#   This does not solely determine if a desktop item will be created as
#   the user must have granted permission to create desktop shortcuts at
#   all during the installation of the application environment this shortcut
#   request is part of. That setting is the ADDTODESKTOP variable stored in
#   custom_tools\Property.dat.  When the Property.dat file does not exist,
#   the default for ADDTODESKTOP is True, which means this setting controls
#   whether the desktop shortcut is created or not.
#
# Notes:
# * The location of icons files, can be specified by the absolute or
#   relative path.  Where a relative path is understood to be relative to the
#   location of this (appinst data) file.
# * The location of the executable command, i.e. the first element in the
#   value corresponding to 'cmd', is assumed to be located in sys.prefex/bin
#   (on Windows sys.prefex/Scripts, unless the string starts with '..'.
#   In the later case it is assumed to be relative to the location of this
#   (appinst data) file.

SHORTCUTS = [{ # IPython
        'cmd': ['ipython', '-pylab'],
        'comment': 'Pylab in an iPython shell',
        'icon': 'pycon.ico',
