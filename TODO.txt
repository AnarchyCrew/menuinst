- Refactor the common.py module such that it's creation of Window's "Start"
    menus are driven by the same data definitions as the application_menus.py
    module, and move the code into application_menus.py so that we have only
    one entry point for creating application menu's across all supported
    platforms.

- Bug: On Windows, when the install path contains whitespace, the menu,
    desktop, and quicklauch icons don't work.
