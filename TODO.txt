- Refactor the common.py module such that it's creation of Window's "Start"
    menus are driven by the same data definitions as the application_menus.py
    module, and move the code into application_menus.py so that we have only
    one entry point for creating application menu's across all supported
    platforms.

- Change application_menu.py such that it is not depending on enicab specific
  files.  The whole point of the AppInst project is to be an open source
  project, and enicab is not.  If an application, e.g. in EPD, needs
  enicab specific information to the functions in application_menu.py it
  can simply have a post install script which reads the enicab files and
  pass the appropriate arguments to the function in appinst.
