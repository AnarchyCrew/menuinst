2013-??-??: 3.0.0
-----------------



2012-06-12: 2.1.2
-----------------
  * use explorer for filebrowser on Windows (PR 2)

  * fixed shortcuts have wrong executable (PR 3)



2012-04-25: 2.1.1
-----------------
  * added ability to specify a working directory via a 'working_dir' key
 â€¦  in a shortcut definition.  This is then used on win32 only to set
    the 'Start in' directory of the created shortcut.

  * On windows the target length is limited to about 260 chars and we use
    python -m webbrowser instead of running the full path to the module to
    reduce the length of the target.



2011-03-14: 2.1.0
-----------------
  * added menu and shortcut removal ability on MaxOSX and Linux

  * removed registry path stuff on Windows, and hence pywin32 dependency

  * add ability to have a menu icon on Linux <custom_tools>/menu.ico

  * removed separate rh3 and rh4 modules

  * simplified much of the code



2010-12-09: 2.0.4
-----------------
  * This version has been used for a long time.


10 October, 2008 (DP):
    - API: Finished refactoring that created the application_menus.py module
        which allows data-driven creation of application menus for both KDE
        and Gnome on RH3, RH4, and probably other modern Linux distributions.
        The RH4 implementation creates application menu files that conform to
        FreeDesktop.org's Desktop Menu Specification 1.0.  Though users may
        need to modify the application_menus.py module to get it to try that
        implementation on another distribution or version. [22265]
